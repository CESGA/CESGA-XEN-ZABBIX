#This script queries zabbix database to search for hosts in a specific hostgroup (XEN-SERVERS)
#It assumes that every host obtained is a xen-server, so it'll check for nagios_nrpe port (5666) to
#execute check_xen command (using check_nrpe program). Obtains output, parse it, and submit to zabbix.
#
#Usage: install this script as a crontab every X minutes to get stats every X
#Tips: you can add a discovery rule in zabbix to check a network range and tcp port 5666 to auto-add hosts to group in zabbix
#
#TODO: USE THREADS TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE
#TODO: Learn perl to avoid common mistakes that are (that's for sure) present in this code. Sorry :(
